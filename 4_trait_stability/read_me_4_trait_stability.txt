Organization and contents of 4_trait_stability
Performed in R, this step calculates static (AMMI) and dynamic (FW) stability of canopy cover and associated traits

AMMI: Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction Model: Static Stability
	- R markdown file
	- results: Final df with AMMI values for all traits

FW: Finlay-Wilkinson Slope Coefficient: Dynamic Stability
	- R markdown file
	- results: Final df with FW slope values and predictions for all traits
